Sequential design:
1a. How many bits for state will you need?
1b. How many input bits will you need?
2. Then, map states to bits, and map inputs to bits.
3. Write out a state-transition table.
4. Finally, program a ROM to do said thing.

Vending machine
6 States: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 25
1a. How many bits for state will you need? 6 bits, 2^3=8
1b. How many input bits will you need? Nickel, dime quarter (3) 2^2=4
2. Then, map states to bits, and map inputs to bits.
3. Write out a state-transition table. Since 25 cents is the final state, what happens if we get extra currency? Or, what happens if we get foreign currency? Feel free to transition to a "bogus" state (or states) for these purposes.
4. Finally, use a ROM to implement said thing.
